General:
Append url params (handle incoming params properly also in urlfilter) (web2py handles it with args[0], args[1], etc.)
Translations (use the i18n system), simple do a T('my text')


Form:
Edit form view (when user edits a record)
Update record (action=update)
delete record (action=delete)


Ajax:
Ajax calls and feedback (JS submits and load) (I think simply using jQuery should solve it)
